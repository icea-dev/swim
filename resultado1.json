The two service interfaces are: \u2022 AccessAMDBFeatures: This interface provides the user with the requested features from the AMDB (Airport Map Database). The features capable of being requested is a subset of the total set of feature types available from the AFIS (ATM Feature Information Service).. \u2022 AccessAMDBMap: Returns to the user the map of the airport in a graphical form with the features rendered according to a pre-set set of styles. The content consists of 40 FeatureTypes covering geospatial information of an airport layout. An AMDB or parts of it is primarily intended to be used as map layers. Actual Implementation The Avitech SWIM product provides a service which covers the first half of the envisioned functionalities for this service, i.e. the storage, query and management of Airport Features over a standardized interface. In this case WFS-T v2.0, providing Airport Mapping data either in AMXM or in AIXM 5.1 format. Notification about changes is possible through a publish/subscribe mechanism, based on REST and XPath.
