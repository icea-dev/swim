AcknowledgeWeatherReport(WMSCR)|['This document describes one of the Weather Message Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) SWIM services.

This document was prepared in accordance with FAA-STD-065A [1].', 'The WMSCR system is operated by the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) and is used to acquire and disseminate weather and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) information to a variety of end users over a national communication network.

The WMSCR system stores and distributes Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) Data Acquisition System (ADAS) and Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) data. ADAS produces METAR report which created based on the One Minute Observation (OMO) data. WMSCR SWIM services are authoritative source for PIREP and Altimeter Setting information. The Altimeter data is extracted from the METAR report and is a part of the OMO.', '.', 'The current WMSCR platform provides capabilities to accept, store, disassemble, reassemble, schedule, deliver, and archive a wide variety of textual weather and NOTAM messages.\xa0 WMSCR SWIM based services enable request/response and publish/subscribe message exchange patterns to disseminate PIREP ((Pilot Weather Report) and Altimeter data.

Clients, who have been listed as subscribers, can connect with the NEMS, using the JAVA Message Service (JMS), to retrieve the PIREPS and Altimeter Setting information published to it by the WMSCR SWIM FEP.\xa0 The external messaging for WMSCR SWIM uses OGC GML standards, a subset of the WXXM schema for message formatting, and data definitions from the urn:us:gov:dot:faa:weather:iesp:nwrx:1.0 namespace', 'The SWIM-enabled Weather WMSCR PIREP and Altimeter Settings publication went operational in June 2012.
