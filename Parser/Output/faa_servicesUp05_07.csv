TFMDataR13|['Flight']|['Arrival and Departure']|International Data|The International Data business function provides the capability for TFM to exchange flight data with IDP. The message set was originally designed based on the 2007 and 2012 versions of “Doc 4444 ATM/501 Procedures for Air Navigation Services” from International Civil Aviation Organization.

TFMDataR13|['Flight']|['Arrival and Departure']|Terminal Flight Data|Terminal Flight Data business function includes data exchanges that are part of the surface movement flow management.

The outgoing data consists of flight updates similar to the input with the additional related data provided by airline participants via the Flight Data Block request-reply service business function. Figure 5‑7 Terminal Data – Output shows the messages that comprise the output. Detailed definition of both input and output messages and their contents is provided in Appendix B Table B-12 Terminal Flight Data.  Note that both the input and output Terminal Flight Data messages reference FIXM Core v3.0 Schemas and FIXM US Extension v3.1 Schemas in the flight object since neither, on its own, satisfied all of the required content.|Out
