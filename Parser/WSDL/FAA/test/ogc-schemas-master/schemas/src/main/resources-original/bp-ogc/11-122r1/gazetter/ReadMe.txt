This document defines a Gazetteer Service profile of the OGC Web Feature
Service Standard. The OGC Gazetteer Service allows a client to search and
retrieve elements of a georeferenced vocabulary of well-known place-names. This
profile extends the WFS interface in a way that a client is able to - Determine
if a WFS implementation is acting as a Gazetteer Service. - Query the Gazetteer
Service in order to retrieve place-name features without closer examination of
the feature type definitions - Access metadata about the gazetteer(s) provided
by the service - Update place-name features using WFS transactions - Fetch
place-name features that have Parent-Child relationships and then follow those
links
