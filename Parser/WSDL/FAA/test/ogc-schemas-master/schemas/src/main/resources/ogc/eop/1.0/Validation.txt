OGC(r) GML 3.1.1 Application Schema for Earth Observation Products
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.1.1 Application Schema for Earth Observation
Products Implementation Standard is defined in OGC document 06-080r4. 

EOP 1.0 (1.2.2) does not validate. -- 2014-03-28

It seems that 06-080r4 (EOP 1.0) is approved as an official OGC
implementation standard. Unfortunately, it called for the use of a
non-standard gmlSubset.xsd based on GML 3.1.1 (and using the GML 3.1.1
namespace) but using some GML 3.2.1 definitions.  This means that EOP 1.0 
is not GML 3.1.1 nor GML 3.2.1 but some modified version of the two.  
This is not documented anyway in the standard.  The problem that the 
EOP document was trying to overcome was corrected in 3.2.1.

EOP 1.0 (06-080r4) is being published in a zip archive so that the schema 
are available but not directly usable. Earth Observation Metadata profile 
of Observations & Measurements (1.0) 10-157r3 should be a replacement.
