OGC(r) Download Service for Earth Observation Products Best Practice (DSEO)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

OGC Document ID:  13-043
Document Version: 1.0.0
Document type:    OGC Best Practice
Date Published:   2014-01-31

This OGC(r) Best Practices document specifies the interfaces, bindings,
requirements, conformance classes for online download of Earth Observation
products. This protocol covers several scenarios implemented by European Space
Agency - ESA for providing its products to users:  The EO Product to be
downloaded is already available and can be downloaded as it is. The EO Product
is not online available but is stored in a near online archive. The EO Product
is advertised in a Catalogue, but it is not physically available and it has to
be generated on the fly by a processing facility. The EO product is archived in
several distributed online archives and it can be downloaded in parallel. The
basic scenarios can be simply supported by Web Browsers, the most complex ones
need a dedicated client (download manager) supporting Metalink and multisource
download. This Best Practice document has been prepared basing on the work
performed in the frame of ESAâ€™s Next Generation Earth Observation user services
and it was initially produced during the ESA.
