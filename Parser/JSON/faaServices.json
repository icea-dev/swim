The enhanced elements include (but are not limited to) converted route information, entry/exit data for certain TMI\u2019s, other computed date such as RAPT timeline data, NTML restrictions, and more. There is also specific support for International users such that they can provide TFMS their data and vice versa all in FIXM format. Similarly TFMData supports the TFDM program by providing Airline provided data to the TFDM system."
